# Student Management System (Java)

## Project Overview
The **Student Management System** is a Java console application to manage student records efficiently. Users can add, view, update, search, and remove student information through a menu-driven interface. Each student has a unique five-digit ID automatically generated by the system.  

This project demonstrates my abillity in **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles, input validation, error handling, and the use of Java collections.
